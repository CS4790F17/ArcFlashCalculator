    <h3>About the Arc Flash Calculator</h3>
    <p>This application was modeled after E-Safe Pro which was created by the US Army Research Laboratory and DoD's Defense Safety Oversight Council Electrical Safety Working Group.</p>
    <p>This version of the application was developed by students at Weber State University</p>
    <p>This application is intended to be utilized by <strong>TRAINED</strong> and <strong>QUALIFIED</strong> personnel who must design, repair, troubleshoot or install potentially hazardous electrical equipment in the performance of their duties. It is not intended as a stand-alone electrical safety guide, rather as a single part in a larger overall safety analysis. Additional training may be required as deemed adequate by supervisory staff.</p>
    <p>As determined by your Command's Electrical Safety Office, training may include:</p>

    <p>Information presented is organized using the Electrical Hazard Classification Tool, 2012 edition. The Tool is a graphic representation of electrical hazards as determined by possible injury, and provides the recommended controls for mitigation of the hazard for the various Modes of Work on Electrical Equipment. This classification tool is not to be confused with the hazard risk categories for personal protective equipment defined in NFPA 70E. Work Controls are based on, as applicable, the NFPA-70E Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, 2012 edition, and PPE is taken from the NFPA task table 130.7.</p>
    <p>This application assumes that equipment has been properly maintained and used as intended.</p>
    <p>All calculations and recommendations must be reviewed and approved by your organization’s Electrical Safety Subject Matter Expert.</p>
